**** Thank you for purchasing the Ultimate Game Music Collection ****

My aim with this package has been to create a large library of music, diverse enough to be useful in any game project and affordable enough for developers at all points in their careers.

I hope that you find the music in this package useful and wish you the best of luck with whatever you’re working on.

Thank you,

John.
